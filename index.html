        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a computer science graduate from the University of Pittsburgh. My ultimate goal is to propel society forward and make a lasting impact. Initially I was a chemistry student but ultimately shifted to computer science because I truly believe that the age of technology is only beginning to ramp up. The possibilities are endless. I enjoy solving problems and look to manipulate data in order to configure analytical solutions in a methodical and surgical manner. I love meeting new people and talking about tech. I thrive in teams as I always understand and play my role, but also enjoy independent work while listening to lofi r&b. I also enjoy basketball and love talking about sports.</p>
