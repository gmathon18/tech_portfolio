            <h1>HERE'S A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME!</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Gurmail Mathon. I am a computer science graduate from the University of Pittsburgh. Initially, I was a chemistry student but ultimately shifted to computer science after taking a few programming classes and falling in love instantly. I truly believe that the age of technology has only begun and the possibilities are truly endless. I enjoy solving problems and look to manipulate data in order to configure analytical solutions in a methodical and surgical manner. My ultimate goal is to impact society and leave it a better place for the next generation. I love meeting new people and talking about tech. I thrive in teams as I always understand and play my role, but also enjoy independent work while listening to lofi r&b. I also enjoy basketball and love talking about sports.</p>
            <p>If you would like to talk about technology, sports, or just want to connect, feel free to reach me through my contact page. I love connecting with new people as I believe that a sense of community can be very powerful and can be very impactful in our growth.
